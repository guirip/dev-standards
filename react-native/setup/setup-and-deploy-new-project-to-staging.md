  - Go to the emails you just got for the two deployments
  - Copy the url that the *Install* button points to and remove the end bit so that it finishes
    with `/releases/`
- Go to [smarturl.it](https://manage.smarturl.it)
- Create a new link
  - Default URl: `Trello url`
  - Device Destination:
    - iPhone: The AppCenter iOS Download & Feedback `Public Page url`
    - iPad: The AppCenter iOS Download & Feedback `Public Page url`
    - Android: The The AppCenter Android Download & Feedback `Public Page url`
  - Organize
    - Custom Alias: `smarturl.it/<projectName>`
   
   
 ### 7. Troubleshooting
 
 If 'Cloning GitHub repo' takes more than 2 minutes: the github servers may be untrusted Trigering a `git clone git@github.com:bamlab/certificates.git` will fix it.
